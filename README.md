# Etch-A-Sketch Project

This project is a simple yet interactive drawing board implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the classic toy, the Etch-A-Sketch allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over squares, creating a pixelated drawing experience. Users can also dynamically resize the grid by entering a new number of squares per side.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Draw on a 16x16 grid by hovering over squares.
- **Grid Resizing**: Resize the grid by entering a new number of squares per side. The grid will automatically adjust while maintaining the total display area.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid adapts to the viewport width, ensuring a consistent drawing experience across devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Change the color of the grid squares on hover, simulating the traditional Etch-A-Sketch experience.
- **Random Color Generation** (Optional): Randomize the squares' colors upon interaction for a unique drawing experience.
- **Progressive Darkening Effect** (Optional): Darken the square by 10% with each interaction, leading to a fully blackened square after ten interactions.
